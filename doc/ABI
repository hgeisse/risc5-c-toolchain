1. Register Usage
-----------------

  R0		function return value (caller-save)
  R1   -  R3	procedure/function arguments (caller-save)
  R4   -  R7	temporary registers (caller-save)
  R8   -  R11	register variables (callee-save)
  R12		reserved for assembler
  R13		reserved for OS kernel
  R14		stack pointer
  R15		procedure/function return address (hardware)

caller-save registers are not preserved by the callee across procedure calls
callee-save registers are preserved by the callee across procedure calls
