1. What is the endianness of RISC5?
2. Is the offset in memory instructions (format F2) sign-extended?
3. The SUB instruction "also sets the C flag". How is this to be
   interpreted? Example: compute 3-5. If you really subtract in
   binary, the carry will be set. If you add -5 in 2's complement
   representation, the carry will be cleared.
4. What happens on (synchronous) exceptions?
   a) unaligned word access
   b) unknown instruction
   c) division by zero
   d) floating-point overflow
   e) floating-point underflow
5. What happens exactly on interrupt?
6. Are nested interrupts supported?
7. Does STI delay the setting of intenb by one instruction?
   Does RTI automatically set intenb?
   If both questions are answered negatively, then there is
   a race condition in the sequence (STI, RTI), with a nested
   interrupt as a possible result.
8. Can external devices other than the timer interrupt?
9. All external devices are grossly underspecified.
