The program 'wrtvbr' builds a sample volume boot record (VBR) and
writes it as the first sector to a partition on a disk image. The
VBR is usually meant to load an operating system from its partition
(possibly with the help of a special loader program), but the VBR
contained in 'wrtvbr' cannot do that. It prints a message instead,
and returns.
